# SpringBootMVC
Spring Boot MVC, Thymeleaf

Good day, everyone.

Here I present a very cool little Spring Boot MVC template project.

What is MVC? Well, first and foremost, it is an architectural design pattern, common across many languages. It is forced on us by the standards of the Internet. In a nutshell, MVC provides programmers with a way to translate from HTML to a different language(Java in our case), in order to take in input, process it and return a result - typically a view. Or in case of microservices - return an object(JSON, XML, text, etc).

I can go on and on about MVC, and how amazing it is. But I will expand on this later.

Thank you for your time!
