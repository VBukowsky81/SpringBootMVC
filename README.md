# SpringBootMVC
Spring Boot MVC, Thymeleaf, H2

Good day, everyone.

Here I present a very cool little Spring Boot MVC template project.

What is MVC? Well, first and foremost, it is an architectural design pattern, common across many languages. It is forced on us by the standards of the Internet. In a nutshell, MVC provides programmers with a way to translate from HTML to a different language(Java in our case), in order to take in input, process it and return a result - a view (new HTML page). Or in case of microservices - return data object(JSON, XML, text, etc).

Mostly, actual MVC processing is based on URL resource end-point mappings. How you set up these end-points is up to you.

This project uses Thymeleaf as template engine, which is probably the best engine currently available, and is much better than JSP(static and dynamic templates, ability to run anywhere, great syntax, etc). Template engines are simply view resolution systems. H2 - fantastic in-memory database.

I can go on and on about MVC, and how amazing it is. But I will expand on this later.

Thank you for your time!
